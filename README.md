# ansible-role-grsecurity

Build and install Linux kernels with the grsecurity patches applied.
Supports "test" and "stable" grsecurity patches. Using the "stable"
patches will [require subscription](https://grsecurity.net/business_support.php).

These configurations were developed by [Freedom of the Press Foundation] for
use in all [SecureDrop] instances. Experienced sysadmins can leverage these
configuration roles to compile custom kernels for SecureDrop or non-SecureDrop
architecture.



The primary components of interest in this repository are:

1. `securedrop-grsec`, the kernel metapackage
2. `build.md`, the guide for building the grsecurity kernel for SecureDrop

## Building the metapackage

Use the Vagrant build VM. `vagrant up` will create the VM and run the Ansible playbook, which will build the `.deb` package and store it in the top level of this repository. You can re-build the package quickly by re-running the playbook with `vagrant provision`.
=======
This repository contains code and documentation related to the grsecurity kernels used by the Freedom of the Press Foundation internally.

There is a role for building the kernel and one for the host to install it on.

The Ansible playbook is compatible with both Debian jessie and Ubuntu trusty — just modify the `target_os` in `./ansible/vars/main.yml`.
